# Evaluating the Accuracy of HawkEye Ocean Color Imagery

## Introduction
This project aims to evaluate the efficacy of the HawkEye satellite sensor in capturing ocean color (OC) imagery, focusing on the Cape Fear River Estuary (CFRE) in southeastern North Carolina. Despite the value of coastal and estuarine environments, their study via remote sensing is challenged by optically complex waters. By comparing in-situ measurements with HawkEye and other satellites' data, this research endeavors to enhance marine conservation and management strategies.

## Objectives
- Collect and analyze 3D sea-truthing data in CFRE.
- Compare HawkEye's performace against traditional satellite sensors and in in-situ measurements.
- Investigate spatial variability in chlorophyll concentrations within the CFRE.
- Assess the accuracy of satellite observations through comprehensive matchup analysis.

## Methodology
Field missions will gather in-situ data, utilizing instruments capable of vertical water column profiling. Satellite imagery from HawkEye, MODIS, OLCI, and OLI will be analyzed for overlapping temporal and spatial coverage with field data. The study emphasizes the intergration atmospheric correction, bio-optics, pigment algorithms, and spatial heterogeneity analyses to evaluate satellite-derived measurements.

## Preliminary Results
Initial findings highlight the potential of HawkEye in providing high-resolution OC imagery, promising improvements in spatial understanding of marine biogeochemical dynamics. Detailed comparisons of satellite and in-situ data will inform the accuracy of OC remote sensing in coastal waters.

## Future Work
The project will continue with the analysis of collected data, matchup analysis, and the synthesis of findings. Results will be disseminated through academic publications, aiming to contribute valuable insights into OC remote sensing and its application in marine conservation.
